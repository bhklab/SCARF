    """Modified version of U-Net, adapted for 3D biomedical image segmentation
    The U-Net is a convolutional encoder-decoder neural network.
    Contextual spatial information (from the decoding, expansive pathway)
    about an input tensor is merged with information representing the
    localization of details (from the encoding, compressive pathway).
    - Original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597
    - Base implementation: https://github.com/jaxony/unet-pytorch
    Modifications to the original paper (@jaxony):
    - Padding is used in size-3-convolutions to prevent loss
      of border pixels.
    - Merging outputs does not require cropping due to (1).
    - Residual connections can be used by specifying
      UNet(merge_mode='add').
    - If non-parametric upsampling is used in the decoder
      pathway (specified by upmode='upsample'), then an
      additional 1x1 convolution occurs after upsampling
      to reduce channel dimensionality by a factor of 2.
      This channel halving happens with the convolution in
      the tranpose convolution (specified by upmode='transpose').
    Additional modifications (@mdraw):
    - Operates on 3D image data (5D tensors) instead of 2D data
    - Uses 3D convolution, 3D pooling etc. by default
    - Each network block pair (the two corresponding submodules in the
      encoder and decoder pathways) can be configured to either work
      in 3D or 2D mode (3D/2D convolution, pooling etc.)
      with the `planar_blocks` parameter.
      This is helpful for dealing with data anisotropy (commonly the
      depth axis has lower resolution in SBEM data sets, so it is not
      as important for convolution/pooling) and can reduce the complexity of
      models (parameter counts, speed, memory usage etc.).
      Note: If planar blocks are used, the input patch size should be
      adapted by reducing depth and increasing height and width of inputs.
    - Configurable activation function.
    - Optional batch normalization
    Args:
        in_channels: Number of input channels
            (e.g. 1 for single-grayscale inputs, 3 for RGB images)
            Default: 1
        out_channels: Number of output channels (in classification/semantic
            segmentation, this is the number of different classes).
            Default: 2
        n_blocks: Number of downsampling/convolution blocks (max-pooling)
            in the encoder pathway. The decoder (upsampling/upconvolution)
            pathway will consist of `n_blocks - 1` blocks.
            Increasing `n_blocks` has two major effects:
            - The network will be deeper
              (n + 1 -> 4 additional convolution layers)
            - Since each block causes one additional downsampling, more
              contextual information will be available for the network,
              enhancing the effective visual receptive field.
              (n + 1 -> receptive field is approximately doubled in each
              dimension, except in planar blocks, in which it is only
              doubled in the H and W image dimensions)
            **Important note**: Always make sure that the spatial shape of
            your input is divisible by the number of blocks, because
            else, concatenating downsampled features will fail.
        start_filts: Number of filters for the first convolution layer.
            Note: The filter counts of the later layers depend on the
            choice of `merge_mode`.
        up_mode: Upsampling method in the decoder pathway.
            Choices:
            - 'transpose' (default): Use transposed convolution
              ("Upconvolution")
            - 'resizeconv_nearest': Use resize-convolution with nearest-
              neighbor interpolation, as proposed in
              https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/
            - 'resizeconv_linear: Same as above, but with (bi-/tri-)linear
              interpolation
            - 'resizeconv_nearest1': Like 'resizeconv_nearest', but using a
              light-weight 1x1 convolution layer instead of a spatial convolution
            - 'resizeconv_linear1': Like 'resizeconv_nearest', but using a
              light-weight 1x1-convolution layer instead of a spatial convolution
        merge_mode: How the features from the encoder pathway should
            be combined with the decoder features.
            Choices:
            - 'concat' (default): Concatenate feature maps along the
              `C` axis, doubling the number of filters each block.
            - 'add': Directly add feature maps (like in ResNets).
              The number of filters thus stays constant in each block.
            Note: According to https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03056, feature
            concatenation ('concat') generally leads to better model
            accuracy than 'add' in typical medical image segmentation
            tasks.
        planar_blocks: Each number i in this sequence leads to the i-th
            block being a "planar" block. This means that all image
            operations performed in the i-th block in the encoder pathway
            and its corresponding decoder counterpart disregard the depth
            (`D`) axis and only operate in 2D (`H`, `W`).
            This is helpful for dealing with data anisotropy (commonly the
            depth axis has lower resolution in SBEM data sets, so it is
            not as important for convolution/pooling) and can reduce the
            complexity of models (parameter counts, speed, memory usage
            etc.).
            Note: If planar blocks are used, the input patch size should
            be adapted by reducing depth and increasing height and
            width of inputs.
        activation: Name of the non-linear activation function that should be
            applied after each network layer.
            Choices (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00853 for details):
            - 'relu' (default)
            - 'leaky': Leaky ReLU (slope 0.1)
            - 'prelu': Parametrized ReLU. Best for training accuracy, but
              tends to increase overfitting.
            - 'rrelu': Can improve generalization at the cost of training
              accuracy.
            - Or you can pass an nn.Module instance directly, e.g.
              ``activation=torch.nn.ReLU()``
        normalization: Type of normalization that should be applied at the end
            of each block. Note that it is applied after the activated conv
            layers, not before the activation. This scheme differs from the
            original batch normalization paper and the BN scheme of 3D U-Net,
            but it delivers better results this way
            (see https://redd.it/67gonq).
            Choices:
            - 'group' for group normalization (G=8)
            - 'group<G>' for group normalization with <G> groups
              (e.g. 'group16') for G=16
            - 'instance' for instance normalization
            - 'batch' for batch normalization (default)
            - 'none' or ``None`` for no normalization
        attention: If ``True``, use grid attention in the decoding pathway,
            as proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03999.
            Default: ``False``.
        full_norm: If ``True`` (default), perform normalization after each
            (transposed) convolution in the network (which is what almost
            all published neural network architectures do).
            If ``False``, only normalize after the last convolution
            layer of each block, in order to save resources. This was also
            the default behavior before this option was introduced.
        dim: Spatial dimensionality of the network. Choices:
            - 3 (default): 3D mode. Every block fully works in 3D unless
              it is excluded by the ``planar_blocks`` setting.
              The network expects and operates on 5D input tensors
              (N, C, D, H, W).
            - 2: Every block and every operation works in 2D, expecting
              4D input tensors (N, C, H, W).
        conv_mode: Padding mode of convolutions. Choices:
            - 'same' (default): Use SAME-convolutions in every layer:
              zero-padding inputs so that all convolutions preserve spatial
              shapes and don't produce an offset at the boundaries.
            - 'valid': Use VALID-convolutions in every layer: no padding is
              used, so every convolution layer reduces spatial shape by 2 in
              each dimension. Intermediate feature maps of the encoder pathway
              are automatically cropped to compatible shapes so they can be
              merged with decoder features.
              Advantages:
              - Less resource consumption than SAME because feature maps
                have reduced sizes especially in deeper layers.
              - No "fake" data (that is, the zeros from the SAME-padding)
                is fed into the network. The output regions that are influenced
                by zero-padding naturally have worse quality, so they should
                be removed in post-processing if possible (see
                ``overlap_shape`` in :py:mod:`elektronn3.inference`).
                Using VALID convolutions prevents the unnecessary computation
                of these regions that need to be cut away anyways for
                high-quality tiled inference.
              - Avoids the issues described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11718.
              - Since the network will not receive zero-padded inputs, it is
                not required to learn a robustness against artificial zeros
                being in the border regions of inputs. This should reduce the
                complexity of the learning task and allow the network to
                specialize better on understanding the actual, unaltered
                inputs (effectively requiring less parameters to fit).
              Disadvantages:
              - Using this mode poses some additional constraints on input
                sizes and requires you to center-crop your targets,
                so it's harder to use in practice than the 'same' mode.
              - In some cases it might be preferable to get low-quality
                outputs at image borders as opposed to getting no outputs at
                the borders. Most notably this is the case if you do training
                and inference not on small patches, but on complete images in
                a single step.
        checkpointing: If ``True``, use gradient checkpointing to reduce memory
            consumption while training. This makes the backward pass a bit
            slower, but the memory savings can be huge (usually around
            20% - 50%, depending on hyperparameters).
            Checkpoints are made after each network *block*.
